## Baobab Software mission.

Baobab Software offers development and maintainance of custom software
and can help you solve complex and non-trivial business problems or create new
competitive products and services.

Despite the fact that ready-made programs and services cover a lot of typical
tasks, zero-code approaches are gaining popularity among startups and 
businesses and facilitate the product development process and are almost ideal 
for quick prototyping, but they cannot cover your specific needs and are not 
suitable for creating highly loaded and somewhat complex systems.

We provide a full range of software development, deployment and support 
services. Our specialists start with conceptual modeling to providing technical
support to users of the final product and preparing updates for new versions.

## Why do you need custom software development?

In essence, custom software development is needed in order to digitize 
your business processes and solve your specific and, as a matter of fact, 
unique problems and thus create benefits for you. Each business deals with its
own peculiar tasks and digitalization allows you to avoid routine and get
you precious time applied to more important activeties. Custom software for 
many companies becomes an advantage and makes them more competitive and 
therefore successful.

## What else can be done by developing custom programs?

Your custom software can:

* introduce a new process for which the functionality of standard software is
  insufficient;
* increase information protection of the company;
* automation / digitalization / robotization of processes;
* increase convenience for your customers or partners by creating a custom
  application or chatbot / site for them;
* in general, go beyond and do something that no one has ever done before.


## What are the benefits of custom software development with us?

To create your own software, you will need:

* **Team.** 
  Engineers, designers, testers and managers. The usual team for a relatively 
  small project is from 4-5 people with different roles in the project and to
  large teams of several dozen people for bigger projects.

* **Processes and methodologies.**
  Usually software devolopment cycle includes requirements collection, 
  business analysis, design, software development, testing, deployment and 
  support and you want to get the result within a budget and time limits.

* **Technologies.**
   Last, but not the least. You must be accustomed to and be able to use modern
   technologies: AI & machine learning technologies, undestand the design of 
   high-load and fail-over systems, be able to development fast to develop 
   products faster than competitors and to prevent their aging. Competition 
   in the world of software and digital product development is largely 
   technology competition.

## What do we offer?

* **Guarantees.** We guarantee the launch of projects on time and agreed budgets
  and provide lifetime (indefinite) warranty support for projects with which 
  we have signed a support agreement.

* **Results.** We really launch all projects, support and develop our clients'
  projects many years after launch. Our clients success is the best 
  illustration of the effectiveness of our approaches and solutions.

## Software development process stages

* Product idea.
* Requrement analisys, which includes reviewing existing solutions and 
  analogues.
* Creation of working prototype for further specification and preliminary 
  testing.
* Developmet.
* Testing.
* Resease.
* Deployment if necessary.
* Training.
* Support & improvemnt if necessary.

## Pricing.

The cost of custom software development is traditionally calculated accounting
the amount of time spent by the team and the difficulty of task. To start 
this process you send us your idea or description of the solution requirements 
in a free form. The idea undergoes the process of formalization to the point,
where we understand what should be the result and how this idea can be 
implemented. The more detailed the requirements you provide us, the quicker 
the process goes and more accurate estimation will be reached.

For startups, innovative projects and businesses at the idea stage the estimete 
is extremely difficult and sometimes is impossible, because there are a lot of  
"correct" solutions. In this case, we usually offer to separate the design and
requirements in a separate subproject or we can offer working on flexible 
development methodologies and the principle of payment for time spent.

Thanks to an individual approach to development, you get a solution 
tailored to the specifics of your business, which can become an additional 
competitive advantage or an important element of further digital 
transformation of the company.

The involvement of Baobab Software team in the development at all stages of 
the project, sophisticated processes, well-established technical stack and 
mastery of technology allow us to create reliable and modern digital products 
that work for your business and the result.
